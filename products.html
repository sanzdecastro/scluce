        <h3>Rotation in hand</h3>
        <p>Gira Mini distills the essence of portable lighting into a compact design that retains the virtues of its older sibling. An ingenious ball-joint base, paired with an adjustable shade around a spherical LED core, grants complete freedom of movement, directing light precisely where it is needed. With its battery-powered mobility and dual light intensity, Gira Mini is both exacting and discreet – illuminating the relevant area without drawing attention to itself.</p>

        <h3>Singular Grooves</h3>
        <p>Cirio Pana reimagines the traditional long wax candle, a historic ritual object, through the delicate lens of porcelain. More powerful than that of its smaller counterpart, its luminous disc is encased in a shade as tall as it is wide, producing a light that is both focused and expansive. With unique nuances in every pieces, its grooved texture recalls the softness and depth of corduroy (pana in Spanish), traced by fine vertical ridges.</p>
        <p>Handcrafted in <a href="" target="_blank">Sargadelos</a>.</p>

        <h3>Refinement Upon Refinement</h3>
        <p>With a mastery of form and function, Miguel Milá distilled the three basic elements of any lamp: structure, electrical components and shade. A cross-shaped base, a sturdy vertical shaft and a lightweight frame supporting the bulb holder. The shade rotates around its axis and adjusts in height with a simple rubber ring  –like a sail hoisted up a mast. And, of course, its hallmark on/off switch: a gentle tug on the cord. Light yet robust, it is easily moved.
            A direct evolution of the TMM (1961), this lesser known yet even more refined design is the culmination of Miguel Milá’s relentless quest for simplicity. Stripped to its essence, nothing can be taken away. TMA’s naked form speaks to its economy: this is the most accessible and youthful member of the TM family.</p>
